Description: NZMastersample allows the user to generate sample locations for monitoring designs. The sample locations are drawn from a master sample of New Zealand. Sample locations can be generated for linear or areal (continuous) resources. The benefit of deriving sample locations from a master sample is the ability to coordinate monitoring efforts within/between agencies and maintain robust design in the midst of changing sample frame boundaries, changes in sample size etc.
